    Update Frangipani & Raft:
    1. For `frangipani/server.go`, I changed some snapshot-related
       logging to log important debugging info.
    2. For `raft.go`, I modified `(*rf).Snapshot()` to make the func
       atomic. Previously I released the lock before `persister` saves
       the state and snapshot to allow more concurrency, but it was
       problematic when the leader wanted to send `InstallSnapshot`
       while taking snapshot for itself, which caused the follower to
       receive a new header with an old snapshot.
